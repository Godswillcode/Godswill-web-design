      <h1>If you are considering why a website is so important to business – I’ve broken it down for you in the list of advantages below:</h1>
         <div class="div-1">
      <h4>1. Simple to Set Up</h4>
      <p>Many small business owners spend hours trying to build their own rookie site because they don’t want to splash the cash. Building and maintaining a website is easier than ever before with a online website builder, you can have a proficient and speedy network set up in hours. You don’t need to rely on anyone to update it for you; you can use their expert database at any time to keep your site intact.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-2">
      <h4>2. Cuts Costs</h4>
      <p>Having an online business can cut the cost of staff, shop rent, tax and utility bills. You can liaise directly with the consumer and arrange the delivery for a fraction of the price. On the other hand, if you’re a larger company and have an internal forum you can interact with your staff members eliminating the need for endless meetings and large travel bills.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="div-3">
      <h4>3. Improves Customer Service</h4>
      <p>It’s a known fact that having a web presence will help you improve your customer service. If you’re a store owner and have staff-members, you can’t oversee them 24/7 to observe how they are interacting with clients. In the online world, however, nothing stays secret; you can monitor your staff’s work and ensure your customers are receiving a speedy and helpful reply.</p>
         </div>
        <div class="div-4">
      <h4>4. You Can Create Return Business</h4>
      <p>Anyone can easily lose a plumber’s business card or forget the name that their neighbour recommended. However, if you have a website, they can easily store you in their favourites and return to your site whenever they need information or your services.” According to webdezign: “The use of interactive media, helpful information, questions & answers and forum software can maintain a high level of dialogue and thus help in securing customer loyalty.”</p>
        </div>
         <div class="div-5">
      <h4>5. A Time-Saver</h4>
      <p>It’s a great time-saver for the customer and yourself – you don’t have to lug products to and from your warehouse to a store and the client doesn’t need to walk around aimlessly looking through racks or shelves for their desired purchase. “Studies show that once a consumer has an idea of what they need or want, they start researching, and 72 percent of them go online to find educational material, reviews, and testimonials” according to a recent buyer journey report.</p>
